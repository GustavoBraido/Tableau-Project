The Inc. 5000 list is a ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in the United States, which is compiled annually by Inc. magazine. In 2014, the list included a total of 5,000 companies, which were ranked based on their revenue growth over a three-year period

The list provides a snapshot of the most successful businesses in the country, as measured by their ability to rapidly increase their revenue and create jobs.

The list is widely recognized as a prestigious honor for private companies, and is seen as a benchmark for measuring success in the business world.

Data: Rank, Company, Workers, State, Growth, Revenue and Industry

Using a data collection that I previously cleaned in **Excel**, I generated a dashboard with the following parameters:

1- Sum Rank by Company

2- Sum of Revenue by Company

3- Total Growth by State

4- Total Workers by Company

5- Total Growth per Company

6- Sum Total Growth by Industry
